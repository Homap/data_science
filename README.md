# Processing data with Python and R

This github repository contains our activity in every session of data science held at the Evolutionary Biology Centre on Tuesdays at 13:00 to 14:45.
The structure of the directory is as follow:
* Directories (folders) containing date, e.g. `09.07.2019` summarizes the concepts we learn every session. In some sessions, we only focus on problem solving. All exercises are to be found in the folder `exercises`. They are numbered regardless of the date of the session. If solved, `SOLVED` is indicated next to each exercise. The solution to each exercise is found in `exercises_solution`.
