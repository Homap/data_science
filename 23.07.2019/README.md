## Some conda
* material from the [CodeRefinery workshop](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/04-reproducible-envs/)

## Pythoning

In this session, we plan to look into the following issues:

* 1. Solve Exercise 4 and Exercise 5. 
* 2. Have an lecture on conda, miniconda and anaconda and how they can be used as an alternative for virtualenv
* 3. We want to start putting together different methods in handling the most commonly used file formats in genomics by all of us. We start the journey by GFF and VCF file formats. To this end, we want to understand each file format and find tools in python or elsewhere that can parse and summarise these data formats in the most efficient way possible. This will take longer than one session, we will start with GFF and continue with VCF and other file formats in the coming sessions.
